Wild Emperor penguins are only found in Antarctica. 
Wild Emperor Penguins breed and raise their young mostly on ‘fast ice’, a floating platform of frozen ocean which is connected to the land or to ice shelves. 
From birth, Wild Emperor Penguins spend their entire lives in and around the Antarctic ice, although very rarely vagrants have turned up off the coast of New Zealand.
